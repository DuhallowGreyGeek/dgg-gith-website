# Documentation Website Maintained in Github
* The main reason for creating this page is to have something to link to from the website index.md to link to. 
It also gives the opportunity to practice making a change involving more than one file. 
* The purpose of this website is to document at the highest level the various projects I have on the go.
* The pages for this website are written in Markdown and processed using Jekyll
