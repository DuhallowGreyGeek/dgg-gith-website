# dgg-gith-website
DGG's Github website repository
This repository contains the pieces of the website I'm going to use to document various projects.
To begin with it will be highly experimental and over-commented and documented.
As time progresses I plan it will be more sensible.

At this point the website contains 2 pages: the main index.md page plus one other which describes this project.
